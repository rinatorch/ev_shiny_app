# Electric Vehicles in Maryland Shiny App

The U.S. Department of Energy maintains an API of electric vehicle stations. I zoomed in on an analysis of Maryland Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and added county and tract level features to explore the data. The app's second page includes data from Maryland database of electric vehicle registrations.

Explore the app [here](https://rinatorch.shinyapps.io/evs-in-md/).See how I accessed the API and grabbed Census data [here](https://github.com/rinatorch/ev_shiny_app/blob/main-branch/first_shiny_app/evs-in-md.rmd) and view the app script [here](https://github.com/rinatorch/ev_shiny_app/blob/main-branch/first_shiny_app/app_layout.r).
